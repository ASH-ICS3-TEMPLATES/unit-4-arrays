### The Lesson: Displays

Today's the day - let's get away from the console! We now live in HTML-land!  
From now on the console is for _developer messages_ and _debugging_ (it is a very good tool for testing and debugging!).

For now this "lesson" is more of an interactive demonstration in class. Please follow along with your teacher. You will be notified if / when this page will be updated.
